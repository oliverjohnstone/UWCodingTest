# Utility Warehouse Coding Test

## Installing
npm install

## Running
node index.js
visit http://localhost:8080/v1/jokes/random to retrieve and cache a random joke
visit http://localhost:8080/v1/jokes/:id to retrieve a cached joke

## Testing
npm test

NB: Test coverage is not very high as I ran out of time but I've written the code in a testable way and have provided a small subset of tests to demonstrate.
